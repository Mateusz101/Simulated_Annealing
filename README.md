I created this project during my third year at AGH University of Science and Technology, studying Informatics and Econometrics. This project represents only a part of the larger project that we worked on as a team, including Tomasz Zapart, Anna Rubin, Adrian Żyła, and Radosław Mocarski. Simulated Annealing was done only by myself, that's why I decided to upload it on my GitHub. The rest of the project can be viewed at https://github.com/RadandMoc/Inteligencja-Obliczeniowa.
